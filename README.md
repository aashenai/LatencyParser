# LatencyParser
This is a Python script which takes in input from the .log file generated by an nvme trace. It then calculates the latency of each IO command: nvme_cmd_read, nvme_cmd_write, and nvme_cmd_dsm (or trim). The script then selects and outputs all commands which cross a certain threshold latency, which is 10 ms on default. It then plots a scatterplot of all the latencies, sorting each type of command (read, write, and trim) in a different color.
## How to run
This program can be run on the command line. It takes in two command line arguments: arg1 (the relative address of the input file) and arg2 (the threshold latency for plotting, optional). Once you navigate to the directory of the script, you need to run the script using "python parser.py arg1 arg2".
